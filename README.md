# Machine Learning Practice
Self practice for implementing basic machine learning algorithms using only
`numpy`, `autograd`, and `scikit`

## Currently implemented:
* [K-Means](code/Kmeans.py)
* [Naive Bayes](code/naive_bayes.py)
* [K-NN](code/knn.py)
* [Linear Regression](code/linear_regression.py)

## Running these scripts

### Requirements
* python 3
* pip 3

### Clone the project
Clone the project to your local machine using:

    git@github.com:salildabholkar/Machine-Learning.git

### Run through wizard:
Make sure `python 3` is being used by doing `python --version`

The wizard directory contains an interactive wizard to
run any script of your choice

To run the root script:

    cd Machine-Learning
    pip install -r frozen-requirements.txt
    python wizard
    
### Running scripts individually:
The scripts can be run individually from the [/code](code/) folder
